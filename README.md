Take-Home Assignment for ADAS Intern Role
Backup Camera Simulation with Object Classification

Overview:
In this take-home assignment, you will simulate a back-up camera with dynamic trajectory of
rear wheels using a 10-second clip from your phone. You will be required to make assumptions
regarding steering geometry and vehicle dimensions and overlay the trajectory of the rear
wheels on the video recorded earlier. The objective is to test your ability to apply your
knowledge of ADAS software development and vehicle dynamics to create a functional
simulation, and basic object classification..
Instructions:
● Record or choose a 10-second clip from your phone, simulating a backup camera's view.
● Assume realistic vehicle dimensions and steering geometry. You can pick any car model
for this exercise.
● Overlay the trajectory of the rear wheels on the video using a graphical interface. Make
sure that the trajectory is accurate and realistic.
● Once you have completed the simulation, submit a link to your repository with the
overlaid video. Include a brief write-up explaining your assumptions and the tools and
techniques you used to create the simulation. Please attach a readme and add clear
instructions on how to run your simulation.
● Use any programming language or software tools you prefer.
Bonus Task: Vehicle Image Classification
Overview:
Classify objects that appear in the backup camera video, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, or
obstacles, feel free to create your own labels and make sure to document them. You are
allowed to use pre-trained machine learning models for object classification.
Instructions:
● Use the provided Vehicles-OpenImages Object Detection Dataset to classify different
vehicle types.
● You may use any pre-trained machine learning model and adapt it to classify the
vehicles in the dataset into their respective categories.
● Use any machine learning frameworks you are comfortable with.
● Include a write-up on your approach, the pre-trained model used, and any significant
modifications or decisions made.
● Please submit your model along with the accompanying documentation in the same
repository used for the main task. Ensure that clear instructions on how to execute your
program are included.
